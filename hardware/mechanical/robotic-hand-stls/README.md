## 🛠️ Printing & Assembly Tips

- **Material:** PLA or PETG recommended
- **Infill:** 30–50% for durability
- **Supports:** Use if needed (especially for fingers)
- **Scale:** Ensure correct scale before printing
- **Assembly:** Use fish wire to connect fingers to servo horns; secure with a glue gun where necessary

## 🧠 Integration

These mechanical parts are designed to be used with:

- **MG996R Servo Motors**
- **Arduino Nano**
- **NRF24L01 wireless modules**
- **Flex sensors**

Refer to the main project’s BOM and wiring diagrams for details.
